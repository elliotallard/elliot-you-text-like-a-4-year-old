 ELLIOT, YOU TEXT LIKE A 4 YEAR OLD


 For the class Data Gardens, I created a generative text-er. Input a message you want to send or have been sent in the "SPEak to me" box & press enter - and I can infuse/transform it to say something I would text at this stage of my life, October 7th, 2019.

 This piece uses text messages that I have sent to others - selected to be silly and anonymous. The text is generated through a modified n-gram algorithm, taken from Dan Shiffman. 

 This piece was inspired by multiple lines of thought - 

 	1) my friend texted me that after being in a conversation with me, I laughed out loud.

 	2) the meaning & language (?) of emoji? How does emoji change the nature of texting, conversation, literature? Is there such thing as emoji syntax? What do emojis do to tone of voice? How do they add to the virtual, the artifice?

 	3) our attention and behaviors are chopped up & condensed by mediums such as text, IM, instagram, Facebook, and smartphones in general. What is it like to create poetry that mimics a fleeting attention span? What tactics exist within this limited attention span?

	This is when I presented it. I tried to style it differently, aggregating the outputs of editor and displaying them. But took to long, will work on it ~eventually~
